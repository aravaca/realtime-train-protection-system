A lightweight **web-based railway simulation framework** replicating key control functions of **JR East/West EMUs**.  
Unlike heavy simulations, PTS is designed for **essential driving skill training** on low-end PCs, as it enables repetitive **braking** and **stop-point accuracy** practice.

Supports:
- **Manual stop control**  
- **TASC-assisted automatic stopping**  
→ allowing direct **human vs. automation** performance comparison.

Powered by **Three.js 3D visualization**, the simulator delivers an immersive driver’s POV and realistic track environment.  
Real-time **velocity–distance** and **braking curve** rendering provides intuitive, instant feedback.

By replicating authentic **EMU physics**, it enables:
- **Repetitive stop training** using the random function
- **Scenario-based evaluation**  
- **Quantitative performance scoring** under diverse track conditions

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI, WebSocket)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Three.js for BVE1-style graphics)
- **Deployment**: AWS EC2 (Amazon Linux), Nginx, Route53, 내도메인.한국

## 🚆 Application Scenarios

- **Operator Training:** Repetitive personal-level stopping practice using simplified simulator hardware  
- **Educational Demonstrations:** Visualization of efficient brake curves 
- **Research & Development:** Testing human–automation interaction (TASC) algorithms    

---

## 🔭 Future Development

Planned upgrades include integration with advanced railway control frameworks and signals such as:

- **ATC (Automatic Train Control)**  
- **ATP (Automatic Train Protection)**  
- **ATS (Automatic Train Stop)**

## 🧠 Why TASC?
- **Reduces driver workload & fatigue**: automatically executes initial, stair-step braking and relaxing → reduces cognitive load and control fatigue.
- **Higher stopping accuracy & consistent ride comfort**: useful when stopping at stations with PSDs (platform doors); always produces a **similar braking profile**.
- **Low-cost and low-risk**: cheaper than ATO systems; TASC allows manual override if equipment malfunctions.

## ⚙️ Config
- **e233_1000.json**
  - `notch_accels`: `[EB, B8, B7, ..., B1, N]` order
  - `tau_cmd_ms`, `tau_brk_ms`: control/brake delay constants
